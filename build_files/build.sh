### Install packages

# All packages this image needs are installed in a single transaction
# rather than spread across several `dnf5 install` calls, each of which
# pays its own repo-metadata-load/depsolve/transaction-check overhead.
# Nothing between here and where these packages are used depends on a
# partially-installed state, so there's no ordering reason to split them.
#
# freeipa-client pulls in sssd, krb5-workstation, certmonger, and other
# required dependencies automatically.
#
# policycoreutils-python-utils provides semanage, used by
# `ujust setup-hibernation` to persistently label the hibernation swapfile
# swapfile_t (systemd's boot-time swapon is denied by SELinux on the
# default var_t label).
#
# alsa-sof-firmware/alsa-ucm are for Chromebook SoundWire/SOF audio
# support (see below); fedora-logos restores stock Fedora branding (see
# "Branding" below); f<ver>-backgrounds-gnome supplies the current stock
# Fedora default wallpaper (see "Wallpaper" below), versioned off this
# build's own Fedora release so it never goes stale on a Fedora bump the
# way a hardcoded package name would; zstd is the compressor the
# initramfs regeneration below asks dracut to use, listed explicitly
# rather than assumed present.
# powertop provides the --auto-tune power-saving profile applied at boot
# by powertop-autotune.service (see below).
# thermald is Intel's own thermal daemon; on 12th-gen ("Alder Lake") hybrid
# P-core/E-core laptop hardware — this image's primary target, see
# CLAUDE.md — it reads the platform's Intel DPTF thermal tables and
# proactively throttles before the kernel's own emergency thermal shutdown
# has to step in, which otherwise tends to show up as abrupt, coarse
# frequency cliffs under sustained load rather than the smoother ramp
# thermald manages.
# libva-intel-media-driver provides the "iHD" VA-API backend for Intel's
# Gen9+ (which includes Alder Lake's Xe-LP) integrated graphics, giving
# hardware video encode/decode instead of a software fallback — see the
# LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME default and enable_guc=3/HuC note below for why both
# pieces are needed together. Note the package name: upstream/RPM Fusion
# call it "intel-media-driver", but Fedora's own (MIT-licensed, patent-
# unencumbered) build of the same driver ships it as "libva-intel-media-
# driver" (source package intel-media-driver-free) — "intel-media-driver"
# itself resolves to nothing in this image's enabled repos.
# acl provides setfacl/getfacl, used by homebrew-install.sh's first-boot
# Homebrew install to set a default ACL on the shared Homebrew prefix -
# needed so newly created Cellar/etc. entries stay group-writable for
# every 'brew' group member regardless of that user's umask (plain
# chmod/setgid alone isn't enough - see homebrew-install.sh).
# --allowerasing is required for fedora-logos, which conflicts with
# generic-logos (the Bluefin base image's replacement for it) — it only
# erases packages that actually conflict, so it's safe to apply to the
# whole transaction rather than isolating it to just that one package.

### Preserve FreeIPA join state across bootc updates
#
# bootc performs a three-way /etc merge on update: it diffs old-image /etc
# vs new-image /etc and applies that delta to local /etc. Files that
# ipa-client-install creates and that are NOT shipped in this image are
# treated as local additions and are never touched by updates.
#
# Strategy: create the directory skeleton here so the paths exist at first
# boot, but deliberately ship NO config file content. ipa-client-install
# then owns those files entirely, and bootc will never overwrite them.

install -d -m 0755 /etc/ipa
install -d -m 0750 /etc/sssd/conf.d

# sssd's own runtime/cache directories under /var, plus certmonger's
# (already-existing, RPM-owned) state directories, are declared via
# systemd-tmpfiles rather than created directly here — see var-state.conf
# for why (bootc container lint's var-tmpfiles check, and avoiding baking
# content into /var at build time that a real first boot can create itself).

### Chromebook SoundWire/SOF audio support (e.g. Tiger Lake "Volteer" boards)
#
# Many recent Chromebooks — including Tiger Lake models such as Google's
# Volteer family (e.g. "Lindar"/"Lillipup") — drive audio entirely through
# Intel's SOF (Sound Open Firmware) DSP over SoundWire, with no
# conventional HD-Audio codec. Two separate things are required for the
# built-in speakers to work, or the desktop shows only a routeless "Dummy
# Output" sink:
#
#   1. The kernel must let SOF (dsp_driver=3) or auto-detection
#      (dsp_driver=0) claim the audio controller. Some distro images/
#      installers ship a modprobe.d override forcing the legacy HD-Audio
#      driver (dsp_driver=1), which prevents the SoundWire codec/amps from
#      ever being set up — no sound card is registered at all in that case
#      (not even at the kernel level). This image never ships such an
#      override, but remove one defensively in case a future base-image
#      layer introduces one.
rm -f /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-legacy.conf

#   2. Even once the card exists, WirePlumber/PipeWire import ALSA cards
#      through the ALSA UCM (Use Case Manager) database — a card with no
#      matching UCM profile only gets a routeless stereo-fallback node
#      ("Dummy Output"). Upstream alsa-ucm-conf does not cover every
#      Chromebook SOF card name (e.g. "sof-rt5682", used by Volteer boards
#      with an RT5682 headset codec and RT1011 speaker amps over
#      SoundWire). alsa-ucm-conf-cros is a community-maintained overlay of
#      UCM profiles for Chromebook SOF boards — it probes DMI
#      product_family and i2c modalias at runtime, so this one overlay
#      covers many Chromebook boards, not just Tiger Lake. alsa-sof-firmware
#      (the DSP firmware) and alsa-ucm (the Fedora package providing
#      /usr/share/alsa/ucm2 — not "alsa-ucm-conf") are installed in the
#      single combined transaction above; the overlay layers on top of the
#      upstream UCM2 tree that alsa-ucm installs.

# The repo's only/default branch is "standalone", not "main".

### Register a "Chromebook" keyboard input source, selectable in GNOME Settings
#
# On Chromebooks converted to run this image via MrChromebox coreboot
# firmware, every Chromebook-specific key (Search/Launcher -> Super, the
# action-key top row, the Overview key) is already remapped to its correct
# evdev keycode by firmware/kernel defaults and picked up generically by
# /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet, which every XKB layout includes
# regardless of which one is active - the same firmware-dependency pattern
# documented for SOF audio above (see README's "No Sound on Chromebook
# Hardware" section). Plain "English (US)" therefore already behaves
# correctly on this hardware, and GNOME's Input Sources picker only ever
# lists XKB layouts/variants (symbols-level config), never the XKB *model*
# (set separately, per-machine, via `localectl set-x11-keymap ... chromebook`
# for keyboard-geometry purposes) - so there is nothing actually broken to
# fix here.
#
# This variant therefore changes no key bindings; it exists purely so
# "Chromebook" is a real, selectable, unambiguous entry in the picker
# instead of requiring users to trust that "English (US)" already does the
# right thing on this hardware.

# Idempotent: guards against a duplicate section if a future
# xkeyboard-config version ever ships one of this name upstream.

// Added by bluefin-freeipa: a labeled GNOME input source for Chromebook

// touched here (already correct at the firmware/keycode level for every

// defaults can't provide: a Home/End/PageUp/PageDown/Delete cluster,
// which this hardware has no dedicated physical keys for at all (ChromeOS
// only ever reaches them via Search+arrow/Backspace combos). The Search
// key is already this image's Super key system-wide, so Right Alt stands
// in as the Search-combo modifier instead: hold it with an arrow key or
// Backspace for the level-3 symbol below. us(basic) alone does NOT wire
// Right Alt to ISO_Level3_Shift - that binding lives in the separate
// level3(ralt_switch) option and only applies if a machine's XKB options
// string happens to request it - so it's included explicitly here to
// make this variant self-contained. Shift still combines normally on top
// (e.g. RightAlt+Shift+Left still reports Shift in the event state
// alongside the Home keysym, so "select to start of line" keeps working
// in apps that check for it).

### Exclude local sudo accounts from the GDM login screen
#
# On a FreeIPA-joined machine, the accounts worth showing on the login
# screen are domain accounts, not this image's one local (sudo/wheel)
# fallback account. GDM's clickable user list is driven by
# AccountsService, which populates it for BOTH local and domain
# accounts the same way - lazily, as each account actually logs in once
# (not via sssd's enumerate, which stays at its secure/performant
# default of false) - so domain accounts need nothing extra here to
# eventually appear; only the local admin account needs to be kept out.
#
# AccountsService has no supported way to do that after the fact: its
# SystemAccount property is read-only over D-Bus (confirmed live -
# `busctl --system set-property ... SystemAccount b true` fails with
# "Property is not writable"), so this can't be flipped once an account
# already exists. The one mechanism accounts-daemon does honor for this
# is the classic [greeter] Exclude= list in /etc/gdm/custom.conf -
# confirmed by the literal path string "/etc/gdm/custom.conf" present
# in the installed accounts-daemon binary itself, alongside
# "user %s %ld excluded" tracing exactly this check.
#
# The account's username isn't known at image-build time either - it's
# created after this build, by Anaconda kickstart or gnome-initial-setup
# depending on which ISO variant is used, with a name the user picks -
# so the actual exclusion has to happen on the deployed machine, not
# here. This just ships the script and unit that do it at every boot;
# see hide-local-admins-gdm.py for the discovery logic (any local
# /etc/passwd entry, UID >= 1000, in the wheel group) and
# hide-local-admins-gdm.service for why it has to run before GDM starts
# and why every boot rather than first-boot-only.

### Grant the FreeIPA "sysadmins" group PolicyKit admin authority
#
# The "sysadmins" IPA group already gets sudo through a FreeIPA sudo rule
# (configured server-side, on the IPA server itself - not this image).
# That covers terminal `sudo` invocations only; it does nothing for
# PolicyKit-mediated privilege escalation, which is how GNOME Settings,
# gnome-software, gnome-disks, and anything else driven through
# pkexec/polkit asks for admin credentials. Without a rule telling
# PolicyKit about it, "sysadmins" membership is invisible to polkit,
# which only recognizes the local wheel group as admin by default - so a
# sysadmins member with full sudo would still be treated as an
# unprivileged user by every polkit authentication dialog, GNOME's
# included.
#
# Follows https://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/FreeIPA_PolicyKit.html: a JS
# rule registered via polkit.addAdminRule() naming the group as
# "unix-group:sysadmins", resolved through sssd/NSS the same as any other
# unix group, IPA or local. See polkit-sysadmins-admin.rules for why
# unix-group:wheel stays alongside it rather than being replaced.

### Let every user run Tailscale/trayscale without a manual sudo step
#
# By default only root can control tailscaled, so trayscale (which has no
# privilege-escalation UI of its own) does nothing for a normal user until
# someone runs `sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER` for them - and that
# only ever grants operator status to whichever one user last ran it, since
# it's a single value in tailscaled's own state. On a shared/domain-joined
# machine where any user might log in, that means it has to be re-applied
# per user rather than once at setup time.
#
# tailscale-set-operator (shipped to /usr/libexec) sets *only the invoking
# user* as operator, reading who that is from SUDO_USER rather than an
# argument - so the sudoers rule granting it NOPASSWD access can match its
# exact path with no wildcard, and a user can never make anyone but
# themselves the operator. tailscale-set-operator.service runs it via sudo
# at every graphical login (WantedBy=graphical-session.target, a per-user
# unit), so whichever user is currently logged in becomes the operator
# automatically, with no manual step and no password prompt.

# These settings live in volatile kernel/sysfs state, not on disk, so they

# runs it once per boot and reports the unit as active afterward, the same
# shape used elsewhere in this image for a run-once-at-boot action (see
# hide-local-admins-gdm.service, which instead runs every boot for a
# different reason — no analogous "state resets on reboot" need here).

# CPU and its Xe-LP integrated GPU specifically, on top of the
# hardware-agnostic PowerTOP auto-tune above.

# thermald: Intel's own thermal daemon, reading DPTF thermal tables to
# throttle proactively rather than relying solely on the kernel's coarser
# emergency thermal cutoffs. See the package comment above for why this
# matters more on Alder Lake's hybrid core layout than on older,
# homogeneous-core Intel CPUs.

# Bluefin base image build happens to carry — pinning it here removes that
# ambiguity, the same "force it explicitly rather than trust an
# environment-dependent default" reasoning already applied to enable_guc
# above and to the ostree dracut module elsewhere in this script. iHD is
# what actually exercises the hardware encode/decode path that enable_guc's
# HuC bit (above) loads firmware for; without both pieces together, video
# playback/encode falls back to software and costs far more battery.

### Branding — replace Bluefin logos throughout
#
# Bluefin ships logo files in a few places that are visible to users. Boot
# and OS iconography is restored to stock Fedora artwork rather than
# Universal Blue branding, since that's the first (and most systemic)
# graphic set users see:
#
#   1. Plymouth boot watermark (/usr/share/plymouth/themes/spinner/watermark.png)
#   2. GDM login screen logo (/usr/share/pixmaps/fedora-gdm-logo.png and
#      related pixmap files) and the Anaconda installer sidebar logo
#      (/usr/share/anaconda/pixmaps/silverblue/sidebar-logo.png) — both
#      shipped directly by fedora-logos (installed above with
#      --allowerasing over Bluefin's generic-logos), so no override is
#      needed for either.
#
# Two spots keep Universal Blue branding deliberately — they're
# distro-identity touches (a shell extension icon, a terminal banner)
# rather than boot/OS iconography, so they're out of scope for the
# fedora-branding revert above:

### Wallpaper — use Fedora's default background instead of Bluefin's
#
# Bluefin ships its own bluefin-wallpapers package and sets it as the
# GNOME default. Rather than tracking down and undoing whatever mechanism
# Bluefin used to make that the default (it isn't a simple Conflicts-based
# package swap the way generic-logos/fedora-logos is), this forces the
# stock Fedora default background via the same /etc/dconf/db/distro.d
# override mechanism already used above for the Logo Menu icon — a dconf
# override is guaranteed to win over whatever set the previous default,
# without needing to know or replicate that mechanism.
#
# f<ver>-backgrounds-gnome (installed above, versioned off this build's own
# Fedora release) ships the current-year default under
# /usr/share/backgrounds/f<ver>/default/ as a day/night pair; the exact
# filenames (extension and numbering) have changed across Fedora releases,
# so they're discovered here instead of hardcoded, the same way the audio
# and initramfs sections above discover driver names rather than pinning
# them.

# Rebuild the initramfs so the updated Plymouth assets and theme selection
# are baked into the deployed boot image.
#
# bootc requires the kernel and initramfs to live at
# /usr/lib/modules/<kver>/{vmlinuz,initramfs.img} — it synthesizes /boot for
# each deployment from that location and never reads /boot out of the
# container image itself. Plain `dracut --regenerate-all` writes to the
# legacy /boot/initramfs-<kver>.img path instead, which bootc silently
# ignores, so the shipped image ends up carrying the upstream Bluefin
# initramfs (and its bird-branded Plymouth watermark) unchanged even though
# /usr/share/plymouth was updated above. Regenerate explicitly at the path
# bootc actually reads, for every installed kernel.
#
# /root is a symlink to /var/roothome in this ostree-based image (like
# /home -> /var/home), and /var is only a build-time cache mount here, so
# the symlink target doesn't exist yet unless something has created it.
# dracut-install tries to snapshot /root while building the archive and
# fails outright if the symlink dangles ("dracut-install: ERROR:
# installing '/root'"), aborting the dracut run. Create the real target
# directory first so the symlink resolves. Removed again once the loop
# below is done with it (see there) — it's only ever needed as a target
# for dracut-install to snapshot during this build, not as shipped content.
mkdir -p /var/roothome
#
# --no-hostonly avoids hardware-specific probing that fails in a container.
# Each initramfs is built to a sibling temp file and only `mv`'d onto the
# real initramfs.img (atomic within the same filesystem) once it passes a
# sanity check, so a partial/interrupted dracut run can never leave a
# corrupt file at the path bootc boots from. _kver_count tracks how many
# kernels were actually (re)built: if /usr/lib/modules/* matches nothing,
# or matches only entries without a vmlinuz, the loop body never runs, the
# count stays 0, and the explicit check below fails the build instead of
# silently shipping an image with a stale or missing initramfs.
#
# --no-hostonly alone is not enough of a guarantee: it tells dracut not to
# prune modules based on *this build container's* hardware, but the actual
# module set it ends up including still comes from dracut's own defaults,
# which can vary across base-image/dracut-version bumps. A run that quietly
# omits the storage driver a deployed machine actually needs (e.g. nvme,
# ahci, virtio_blk) produces a file that is structurally perfect — non-empty,
# well past the size floor, and parses fine under lsinitrd — while still
# dropping the machine into the dracut emergency shell at boot, because it
# can never find/mount its root filesystem. That happened here: this loop's
# checks were purely structural and let exactly that kind of image through.
# Force the common storage/controller drivers explicitly so the generated
# initramfs's boot-critical coverage can't silently regress, then verify at
# least one of them actually landed in the archive before trusting it.
#
# --compress=zstd: dracut defaults to xz, which optimizes for ratio over
# speed and is the dominant cost of this loop (observed taking tens of
# seconds per kernel in CI). zstd compresses much faster for a modest
# size increase, and since bootc/ostree re-compresses the whole OCI layer
# on top of this anyway, the extra initramfs bytes aren't real waste.
_boot_drivers="nvme ahci sd_mod sr_mod virtio_blk virtio_scsi usb_storage"

# The "ostree" dracut module is what parses the `ostree=` kernel argument
# and runs ostree-prepare-root to bind the actual deployment onto /sysroot
# before switch-root. It is marked hostonly_only by dracut, so it is only
# auto-included when dracut detects it's running on an already-booted
# ostree host — --no-hostonly does NOT pull it in on its own, and this
# build runs inside a plain OCI container with no such host markers.
# Without it, /sysroot ends up as the raw physical filesystem instead of
# the composed deployment, and switch-root fails at boot with "does not
# seem to be an OS tree. os-release file is missing." Force it explicitly,
# the same way 95-hibernation-resume.conf force-adds "resume".
_boot_dracutmodules="ostree"

# Regenerating this initramfs (see above) switched it from dracut's
# hostonly filtering to "generic" (--no-hostonly) mode, and generic mode's
# documented behavior is to bundle every driver dracut can find under the
# kernel's module tree, not just boot-critical ones — that's why this loop
# takes tens of seconds per kernel and produces a multi-MB file even before
# --add-drivers runs. For sound/ that's actively harmful, not just wasteful:
# it pulls in both this image's SOF/SoundWire stack (see "Chromebook
# SoundWire/SOF audio support" above) *and* the legacy snd_hda_intel
# HD-Audio driver, and initramfs's udev coldplug autoloads matching
# drivers for every PCI device it sees — including the audio controller —
# before switch-root, while the real root's SOF firmware
# (/lib/firmware/intel/sof*, from alsa-sof-firmware) and UCM profiles
# aren't mounted yet. A driver that binds the controller that early can
# leave it stuck on the wrong (or firmware-less, non-functional) driver
# for the rest of boot, since kernel driver bindings aren't undone across
# switch-root. No audio driver is ever needed pre-switch-root, so the
# fix is to exclude the entire sound/ driver tree from this initramfs,
# leaving driver selection to happen exactly once, on the real root, where
# snd_intel_dspcfg's dsp_driver=auto logic and the UCM profiles are both
# present. Built from the running kernel's own module tree (rather than a
# hardcoded name list) so it tracks whichever sound drivers that kernel
# actually ships.

### Fix bootc-image-builder ISO manifest generation compatibility
#
# Repos inherited from the Bluefin base image may reference
# GPG keys via local file:// paths in /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/. BIB's anaconda-iso
# manifest generation extracts repo configs from the container image and runs
# dnf dependency resolution inside its own container, which has no access to
# those key files. Patching gpgcheck=0 alone is insufficient — dnf also
# enforces repo_gpgcheck (repomd.xml signature verification) and fails with
# "Signing key not found" when the gpgkey reference is absent.
#
# In a bootc image, packages are never updated via dnf; bootc upgrade pulls
# cosign-verified OCI images instead. These repos serve no purpose in the
# deployed system. Truncate any repo file that carries a local file:// gpgkey
# reference so BIB's manifest generation can proceed without error.
#
# Each directory is searched separately so find exits 0 when the directory
# exists, avoiding a pipefail abort if one of the directories is absent.

### Set up Homebrew for all users (including FreeIPA domain users)
#
# Homebrew is installed to /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew (the standard Linux
# prefix). In a bootc deployment, /home is a symlink to /var/home.
#
# The account is created here, at build time, so /etc/passwd/group ship
# with it on every image. The actual Homebrew installation, though, is
# deferred to a first-boot systemd unit (homebrew-install.service) instead
# of running here: ostree only seeds /var from the image on a machine's
# very first deployment, and leaves an already-provisioned machine's /var
# alone on every later bootc upgrade. Installing the (thousands of files)
# Homebrew tree into /var at build time meant CI rebuilt it from scratch
# every day for no benefit to any already-deployed machine, and even a
# brand-new machine's baked-in copy is immediately superseded by
# Homebrew's own `brew update` anyway. See homebrew-install.sh/.service
# for the actual install logic.
#
# The 'brew' group grants write access to the installation. Local users and
# FreeIPA domain users added to this group can run 'brew install'. Users not
# in the group can still run any package that is already installed.
#
# The linuxbrew user/brew group are declared via systemd-sysusers rather
# than useradd/groupadd, with pinned UID/GID (950/951), instead of letting
# useradd/groupadd allocate whatever system ID happens to be free that day.
# bootc container lint flags plain useradd/groupadd here ("sysusers" check)
# for a real reason: /etc/passwd and /etc/group ARE part of bootc's
# three-way /etc merge on upgrade (unlike /var — see below), so if two
# builds of this image allocate a different UID for the same username (a
# real risk across daily rebuilds, since the free-ID choice depends on
# whatever other system accounts exist in that day's build), the merge
# applies that UID change to already-deployed machines. The on-disk files
# under /var/home/linuxbrew (seeded once, at first install, with the
# numeric UID baked into their inodes) don't get renumbered to match, so
# the account silently stops owning its own files. A fixed UID/GID makes
# every build produce byte-identical passwd/group entries for this
# account, so there's never a diff for the merge to apply.

# under /var/lib/flatpak - see firefox-flatpak-policy-install.sh for the

# script/unit rather than done here at build time (same underlying
# reason as the Homebrew install above: /var/lib/flatpak isn't part of
# this image's own /var at build time).
#
# The policy content itself just ships as a plain data file under

### Seed blank document templates into every user's Templates folder
#
# GNOME Files' "New Document" submenu is populated entirely from the
# user's XDG Templates directory: with that directory empty (the default),
# the submenu doesn't appear at all, and there's no way to start a blank
# document from the file manager. This ships five blank templates - text,
# Markdown, Word, Excel and PowerPoint - so it does.
#
# The .docx/.xlsx/.pptx files are generated here at build time from XML
# spelled out in make-document-templates.py, rather than committed to this
# repo as binaries: an OOXML file is a ZIP container, so a committed one
# couldn't be reviewed in a diff. Generation is byte-reproducible (fixed
# ZIP timestamps), so an unchanged template produces an identical file
# across this image's daily rebuilds and bootc sees no /usr diff for it.
#
# Getting the files into a user's home is a runtime step, not an /etc/skel
# one: skel only reaches accounts created by this image's own tooling,
# while FreeIPA domain accounts - the ones this image exists for - get
# their homes from oddjob-mkhomedir at first login, on whatever machine
# that happens to be. user-templates-install.service is a per-user unit
# run at graphical login, covering local and domain accounts identically.
# See user-templates-install.sh for the per-user seeding stamp that keeps
# deleted templates deleted.
